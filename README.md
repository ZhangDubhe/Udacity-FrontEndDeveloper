So I created this page to link every project in this nanodegree learning period I have done.

Keep a good habit for studying.

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Project 1. Establishing Developer Mindset
Hard to write an essay about this. Besides, there is also no code to show.

### Project 2. Mockup to article
Use basement semantic tag to mock up an article rather than only div. Only div tags seems like very boring.
There is one project name [MOCKUP-TO-ARTICLE](./mockup-to-article/) is doing this.
Besides, [DIV-SOUP-CLEANUP](./DIV-SOUP-CLEANUP/)is also an exersics about this.
To make the page easier on SEO, remember to use semantic tags make more.

To learn markdown, here also records some grammar about the md file.

### Project 3.Animal trading Cards
- Use what you've learned about CSS to convert a design prototype into a functional webpage!

Have fun and be creative üê† üêç üêÖ üêº üê´ ! Writing CSS isn't an exact science, so feel free to experiment. For example, you might want to add rounded corners or a background color to your card. Your submission should resemble the design prototype, but it's okay if it doesn't match exactly, so long as you satisfy all the requirements.

Here is Demo page.[link](./fend-animal-trading-cards-master/card.html)
